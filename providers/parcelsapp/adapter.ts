 * Austrian Post's: its own instants have ParcelsApp's UTC digits to the second
 * (checked 2026-10-16), while the EURODIS copies of the same scans carry the

 * (`CAINIAO_CHINA_LEG`), from the warehouse to the departing linehaul, and the return warehouse

 * except the UK's, on GMT in July. Its transit hub, on GMT+2 for a

 * EcoScooting that Cainiao relays ("Your shipment has arrived at sorting
 * center") are on Madrid's clock as well, as EcoScooting's own are, also for a
 * parcel bound for Portugal.
 *
 * 4PX's page (2026-10-11, two parcels to the US) dates its scans up to the
 * departing flight on China time and the rest in the US. Its destination
 * partner's sorting center, which a parcel to France reaches before any
 * placed scan, is on the destination's clock there. EcoScooting's own
 * instants (two parcels) put its China leg on China time, its order and its
 * Spanish sorting center on Madrid's, and its last mile on the destination's:
 * Lisbon's for a "CNPRT" reference, otherwise Spain's.
 *
 * MailAmericas' older tracker gave each scan its site's offset, China's for
 * the origin leg and the Americas' after it. ParcelsApp relays the wall
 * clocks with no place before the destination's customs. Its Tax ID checks,
 * logged with the label, were dated up to six hours after ParcelsApp first
 * returned them on a parcel to Colombia, and come before that moment only on
 * China's clock, the parcel's origin (2026-10-16). Its scans in the
 * destination matched Cainiao's import customs to the minute on Colombia's,
 * and its "Container reception" AliExpress's own receipt by the local
 * delivery company, which states its offset.
 *
 * EMS's scans at the destination's office of exchange, from its arrival to its
 * departure, are on the destination's clock, as its origin leg is on the
 * origin's (`POSTAL_ORIGIN_LEG`): on a parcel from the UK to South Africa they
 * had the digits of the South African post's own copies, and its unplaced
 * "Held for customs inspection" those of UPU's "Held by customs" at the
 * Johannesburg office. Borrowed from the origin's scans before them, they came
 * an hour late. Its hold at that office ("Held at destination import office")
 * is the same office's scan.
 *
 * FIRST LINE's ("1ST") scans from its arrival at the destination airport are
 * on the destination's clock, as its partner's scans after them are (see
 * `WALL_CLOCKS`). Borrowed from its scans in Shenzhen, they came 15 hours
 * early on a parcel to California.
 *
 * A scan on a fixed clock borrows no neighbour's: borrowed from a GOFO
 * parcel's Florida scans, the label came 3 hours early and Cainiao's "Order
 * received" 12 hours after it, 19 seconds on China time. One in the
 * destination borrows only from a scan placed there, and otherwise takes its
