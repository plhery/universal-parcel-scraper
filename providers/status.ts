/**
 * The universal providers' status map. The parcel app files every scan a
 * universal provider relays under the carrier `unknown`, and no carrier map
 * stands behind those scans: the reading the providers give one is their map.
 * That is a 17TRACK sub-status where it outranks the wording
 * (`seventeentrack/status.ts`), else the wording rules every provider
 * applies (`classifyEvent`: their own vocabulary around the shared language
 * rules). A stage a provider declares and a UPU event code it maps are
 * `carrier_map`, so their scans never reach the app's review. Wording no rule
 * reads has no stage. Notices that are not scans, detail lines and headings,
 * and scans whose wording alone cannot settle a step are left out on purpose,
 * each with the reason.
