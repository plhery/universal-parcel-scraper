 * fails or is slow, a stored history stands, as on the website; a record with
 * no scans yet is no answer, so the refresh's failure is.
 *
 * Ship24 answers 404 for some couriers' parcels until the visitor names the
 * courier, as the page's "Add details" dialog does. With the code of the
 * carrier the parcel is filed under, a 404 is asked once more naming it. A
 * 404 to that keeps the first; any other failure, a rate limit included, is
 * the answer.
