# La Poste / Colissimo

La Poste's unified tracking feed. It serves Colissimo, tracked mail and
[Delivengo](../delivengo/README.md), whose folder points `tracking.adapter` here.
The feed also answers Chronopost identifiers, but can omit international partner
scans and references without indicating incomplete history.
[Chronopost](../chronopost/README.md) therefore uses its own direct adapter.

Numeric tracked-mail identifiers reach the same feed without truncation or
conversion to a parcel number. Their detection rules live in `carrier.json`;
generic numeric lengths alone do not identify La Poste. A thirteen-character
Colissimo, tracked or registered letter number ends in a GS1 key over the ten
digits after its two-character product code, and a Smart Data number's optional
15th character is DPD's ISO 7064 MOD 37,36 key. La Poste is
selected only when that key matches; otherwise it stays a suggestion.

Printed control suffixes are preserved in requests and checked against the
returned shipment identity. A Smart Data number typed without its optional
check character comes back under the full fifteen characters; that identity is
accepted only when the character matches, and becomes `canonical_tracking_number`. La Poste's
[Smart Data guide](https://www.espacetechniqueetqualite.laposte.fr/system/files/public/FICHE%20PRATIQUE_Utilisation%20des%20num%C3%A9ros%20de%20suivi%20SD_Lettre%20suivie.pdf)
describes their use; a suffix alone does not identify the carrier.

## How it works

1. `direct`: one keyless GET of
   `https://www.laposte.fr/ssu/sun/back/suivi-unifie/{number}?lang=fr`, the feed
   the public tracker calls, with the tracker page as `Referer`.
2. `retry`: the same request, up to three times after an HTTP 403, and once
   after a network failure or timeout, only while the original 15-second
   deadline has time left. Until that network retry is spent, an attempt gets
   at most half of the time left, so a request that hangs leaves time for it;
   the retries share the rest, so they never extend the lookup.

While the parcel waits at a post office, relay or locker, the step that read the
feed then asks La Poste's locator for that point,
`https://localiser.laposte.fr/{idPoint}`, the page the tracker links to. It gets
at most three seconds and half of the time left; any failure leaves the point's
name alone. The page is large and a point's address does not change, so a
tracker remembers the addresses it has read and asks once per point.

The feed answers with an array; only the entry whose `shipment.idShip` equals
the requested number is read. `returnCode` 104 is the only positive not-found;
any other non-zero code is inconclusive, so the router can fall back to a
universal provider.

## Notes

- The 403 is usually La Poste's "Site indisponible - Incident en cours" page.
  Despite the wording it is a one-request edge hiccup, not maintenance: the next
  lookup succeeds, and it is most likely on the first request after a quiet
  period. Treating it as maintenance and skipping retries sent roughly ten
  times more lookups to the router, each benching the adapter for an hour. A real
  incident still fails all four attempts within seconds.
- Only a 403 and a failure to reach La Poste are retried. A 429, a not-found or
  a malformed payload won't be fixed by an instant repeat. A hang gets one more
  try rather than the whole budget.
- The retries are three separate runner steps with the id `retry`, not a loop,
  so each rejection keeps its own diagnostics and the `attempts` label on
  `carrier_lookup_total` shows which retry served the lookup. `steps` lists
  tiers (`direct`, `retry`), not attempts.
- The deadline check lives in the `recovers` predicate. An exhausted lookup
  still throws the provider's `UpstreamHttpError` (403), not a
  `BudgetExceededError`.
- Status precedence: incident wording, then event `code`, then `group`, then
  wording. La Poste keeps a failed delivery inside its original group
  ("Incident : livraison impossible" arrives with code `DR1`, meaning
  registered).
- `DISTOU`/`MD1` ("sur son site de distribution. Nous le préparons pour le mettre en
  livraison") is out for delivery, for parcels and letters alike. It is the sort into the
  morning's round: the delivery or a failed attempt follows the same day, and La Poste
  sends no other round scan.
- `PB1` is a delivery that could not happen that day. Parcels word it as a
  coming delivery round, so the code makes it a failed attempt.
- `AG1` means ready for pickup whatever its group or sentence. `DO1` is customs
  entry, `DO2` the release and `RE1` the decision to return the item. Duties paid
  at the door (`DESPAY`) follow the delivery scan and keep it delivered. Pickup and customs are set as `current_stage` because the status
  vocabulary has no value for them.
- Timestamps already carry their Paris offset and are passed through verbatim.
  `isoTime` only validates them; impossible dates are dropped.
- `contextData.partner` names the foreign carrier after export; it becomes
  `delivery_carrier` and `delivery_tracking_number`. An item whose `product` is
  Chronopost names Chronopost instead, whose own tracking holds the scans and
  references this feed can omit, so the tracker asks it too.
- `contextData.merchantName` is the sender the tracking page shows. While the
  parcel waits for collection, `removalPoint.name` names the post office, locker
  or shop holding it and becomes the pickup point. The feed has no address for
  it, but `removalPoint.idPoint` is the point's id on the locator, whose page
  carries the point's record as JSON in `Yext["profile"]`. When its `meta.id` is
  that id, the record's street (`address.line1`) and its postcode and town
  follow the name on their own lines. The point's phone, opening hours and
  coordinates are not read. A delivered parcel has none, collected there or not.
- `arrivalCountry` repeats `originCountry` on some international items, inbound
  ones included. Such a pair stands only while every scan stays in that
  country; otherwise a delivery scan's country is the destination.

## Rejected approaches

- Scraping the public tracker page: it calls this keyless feed itself.
- Retrying a 403 with backoff: the hiccup is brief, so waiting only spends the
  user's deadline.
- Treating every non-zero `returnCode` as not-found: that reports parcels
  missing during a provider outage.

## Limitations

- `location` is the event's country; the feed has no city, and its Chronopost
  items carry no country either.
- The delivery estimate is dropped once the shipment is final or delivered: a
  delivered item can stay non-final with its delivery time as the estimate.
- Recipient blocks and addresses on the shipment and its events are never read;
  events are built from an allowlist of wording, time, country and codes.

## Testing

`npm run test:carriers:live -- testing/frenchDirectCarriers.live.test.ts`
(no env vars) checks a wrong number gets a clean not-found or the recognized 403.
