# bpost

Tracks parcel barcodes through the anonymous batch service used by bpost's
official frontend.

## How it works

One POST requests one barcode and returns minimized history
without a postcode. The single-item GET requires a postcode and can return a
missing-item error for a parcel the batch service knows.

## Notes

The returned item and search barcode must both match. Order references and
ambiguous results need an exact parcel barcode. Status comes from the newest
scan's English wording; pickup availability remains distinct from delivery.
Delivery to the sender is a return milestone; an ambiguous return delivery is
inconclusive. The same cheap lookup lets carrier recognition resolve ambiguous
numeric barcodes; only the batch service's explicit absence reply is negative.

## Limitations

Scan clocks have no offsets. The adapter preserves their local digits and the
provider's order; see [ROUTING.md](https://github.com/plhery/delivery-tracker/blob/main/docs/ROUTING.md) for unresolved
history handling. Weight and dimensions have explicit units. Addresses, recipient data,
delivery instructions and proof assets are excluded.

## Testing

Run `npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/bpost`.
Set `BPOST_TRACKING_NUMBER` outside the repository to check a real parcel.
