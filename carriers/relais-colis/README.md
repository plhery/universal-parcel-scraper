# Relais Colis

Tracks French pickup-point parcels through the public recipient form.

## Retrieval

Each lookup opens the form in its own cookie session, then posts its CSRF token
and the requested number. A reply with history has no search form and names the
parcel once, in its "Votre colis" banner. Each stage can contain several scan
boxes; every box becomes an event in the displayed order.

A reply without history re-renders the form with the searched number beside an
explicit no-history message; only that message proves absence. Redirects,
endpoint errors and invalid sessions remain inconclusive. Both requests share
one lookup budget and caller cancellation.

The number shown must equal the requested one after normalization. Pages with a
second or unlabelled banner or a conflicting form value are rejected, and so is
history without a banner: the form value only echoes the request.

Numeric references remain detection candidates because other carriers share
their shapes. The adapter submits the complete normalized reference and never
shortens it to make a returned parcel match.

## Normalization

Scan sentences supply the status. Paris wall clocks become timestamps; date-only
or invalid clocks remain unresolved history. Unfamiliar current wording cannot
borrow an older delivery state. Planned or ongoing returns are not terminal. Address and recipient containers are discarded
before extracting scan fields.

## Limitations

The adapter returns history without pickup-point details or a delivery estimate.

## Live test

Supply `RELAIS_COLIS_TRACKING_NUMBER` and optionally `RELAIS_COLIS_UNKNOWN_NUMBER`
outside the repository, then run:

```sh
npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/relais-colis/adapter.live.test.ts
```
