# Evri International

Evri's international service, through the [GlobalEco tracker](https://globaleco.app/track/)
that the official Evri tracking page links for international parcels. Domestic
UK tracking is a separate [Evri UK](../evri-uk/README.md) service with its own
browser adapter. A not-found here says nothing about Evri UK. Detection checks
the 16-character barcode's last digit as described there, and lists Evri
International first for a `C` in the sixth place.

## How it works

1. `direct`: one anonymous form POST to `https://globaleco.app/track` with
   `tracking_number`. No cookies, CSRF token, postcode or browser. 15-second
   default deadline (a smaller caller budget and cancellation are honoured),
   1 MB response cap, no retry.

## Notes

- Identity is the requested number in both the `Shipment Details #…` heading
  and the **System Tracking** field. The echoed search input is ignored: the
  portal can replace it with the partner's tracking number.
- The **Carrier** field names the network delivering the parcel abroad and
  **Carrier Tracking** holds that network's number. The result names it as
  `delivery_carrier` and `delivery_tracking_number` only when the parser's label
  table maps the label to a catalog carrier and that carrier's detection offers
  the whole number. Evri's own courier labels, a label the table lacks and the
  barcode repeated in Carrier Tracking name nobody. OSM Worldwide's line names
  USPS, which delivers its parcels under the USPS barcode Carrier Tracking holds.
- The tracker also finds a parcel by that partner number, but this adapter asks
  only by the Evri barcode. A partner's number belongs to the partner: Paack
  reads this tracker for the numbers it gives these parcels (see
  [Paack](../paack/README.md)).
- Aggregators call this tracker "Global Eco" or "GlobalEco"; both are aliases
  of Evri. When an aggregator reports one of these names for a number another
  carrier's rule claims at high confidence, the hint goes to that carrier
  (`core/catalog/partners.ts`), so a Paack number is not filed under Evri.
- Recognition makes the same POST: a parcel with scans is known, and the
  **Parcel not found** heading is unknown.
- Not-found is only the explicit **Parcel not found** heading on the normal
  search form, returned with HTTP 200. That form clears its input, so the POST
  itself scopes the answer; an input naming another number is rejected. A
  404/410 means the endpoint is gone and is a transport error.
- Changed markup, a missing history table or ambiguous identity are schema
  errors.
- Each event is classified by its exact English label. Unknown labels stay
  visible without a stage, and an unknown current label gives `unknown` status.
- Timestamps have no offset or documented zone, even for partner scans abroad.
  They are kept as offset-less `events[].local_time` and `last_update_local` in
  the portal's newest-first order; `events[].time` is omitted and `last_update`
  is null, so the host never reads them as UTC. Clocks aren't sorted across
  legs.
- Paack's scans are the exception. When the Carrier field names Paack, its
  scans from "Arrived In Country" on carry the digits of Paack's own UTC
  instants to the second, so they become instants and the newest gives
  `last_update`, as in [Paack](../paack/README.md)'s lookup of the same reply.
- Because of that, the host first checks universal providers for a dated
  timeline and uses this result as the fallback. It can establish initial
  progress but can't overwrite a richer summary, and it doesn't feed the
  timeline of confirmed instants. The host keeps these scans in a bounded
  `direct_local_history` archive across later universal refreshes. No delivered
  time is inferred.
- A row's comment can state the delivery estimate, month first ("Estimated
  delivery date is: 10-30-2026"). The newest one is `expected_delivery` until
  the parcel is delivered or returned.
- Exact duplicate scans are removed; at most 100 are returned.

## Limitations

- International only; domestic UK numbers use the Evri UK adapter.
- Sender names, destination and outbound links are never read, nor is anything
  in a comment but a delivery estimate.

## Testing

`npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/evri`. The not-found
check needs no env vars; the positive check runs when `EVRI_TRACKING_NUMBER` is
set outside the repository.
