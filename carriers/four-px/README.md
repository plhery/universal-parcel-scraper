# 4PX

The public tracking site sends an anonymous JSON request to its tracking API.
The adapter selects the exact requested parcel and keeps its newest-first scan
order. Multi-package orders require separate parcel histories and fall back to
the providers.

Cainiao-style `LP` references ending in `CN` suggest 4PX without selecting it.
Emile's barcodes of `EM`, sixteen digits and `CA`, on parcels 4PX hands to Emile in Canada,
suggest 4PX ahead of [Emile](../emile/README.md): Emile's history names 4PX as the shipper,
and 4PX's feed holds the whole journey where Emile's holds the Canadian leg, so recognition
settles on 4PX when both know the number. Emile's twelve-digit barcodes stay Emile's.
HTTP recognition uses the same identity-bound feed to confirm matching shipment activity.

The portal displays each scan's `tkDateStr` with `tkTimezone`, an offset or,
for some partners' scans, a zone name. The adapter uses that pair because
`tkDate` carries different clock digits. A scan without a zone, or with a zone
name the clock database does not know, is retained as `local_time`, without an
invented instant. The one exception is "Order information has been transmitted to
…": 4PX sends the partner the order data when its facility measures the parcel
and keeps the facility's clock for it, but labels it with the partner's zone, so
it takes the offset of 4PX's own facility scans. On a parcel to France, 4PX's
copies of La Poste's arrival and transit (arrived at destination, handled by
local carrier, transport to delivery centre, stamped to the second) carry La
Poste's UTC digits under Paris's offset, two hours before La Poste's own scans,
so they are read as UTC. 4PX's own transport rows, to the minute, and its copies
of the delivery round show Paris's clock. Parcels to France's overseas
departments and territories or to Monaco keep the stated offset: no 4PX copy
there has been compared with La Poste's own scans. Asendia Hong Kong's label and
manifest carry Asendia's UTC digits, as Yanwen relays them, under the
destination's offset: a label made as 4PX's facility measures the parcel reads
two hours before the measurement, at the same seconds. They are read as UTC.
4PX can list a partner's scan twice, on the partner's clock and with UTC digits under
the same offset, the offset earlier at the same seconds: a partner's order made as the
facility measures the parcel reads one second after the measurement in the first, and
hours before the pickup in the second. The copy whose digits are its twin's UTC time is
left out; a scan without such a twin keeps its offset.

Event codes map to stages. `FPX_O_IR` and `FPX_O_IRI` relay whatever step a
partner reported, from a label to an arrival abroad, so their wording decides.
A partner's transit scans relayed without a code are staged by their whole
wording. A partner's "In transit" under the delivery code `FPX_D_SD` is a move
toward the office that delivers, days before the round, so it reads as in
transit. Other unknown codes stay unstaged. A partner's qualifier left after an
underscore at the end of a wording, as DPD's (`…_nabn`), is dropped. A
partner's pickup-shop record relayed in place of a wording (the shop's fields,
then `_store_type;pudo_id;pudo_name;…`) is no scan: its shop name and town are
the pickup point.

The server reference can identify a delivery partner's tracking number. Shared
result normalization keeps only a USPS routing barcode's package number, never
the ZIP code before it.
The contact card names the last-mile provider and its website; the adapter
reports the catalog carrier both agree on, never the card's phone numbers, and
provider discovery confirms the operator separately. The feed also answers
partners' numbers, 4PX's `OLS` references and its twelve-digit waybills, which
detection does not route here: twelve digits are shared by many carriers and no
range of 4PX's is known. It also follows the Cainiao Express `DOFR…HD` numbers of parcels 4PX hands to
Cainiao Express in France, from the first mile; Cainiao answers them only once Cainiao
Express has the parcel, without 4PX's leg. Aggregators name 4PX "4PX Express" for those, and
that name is an alias, so their naming leads to this adapter, which still has to find the parcel.

Run `npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/four-px`.
Set `FOUR_PX_TRACKING_NUMBER` outside the repository to check a real parcel.
