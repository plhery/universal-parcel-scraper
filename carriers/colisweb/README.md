# Colisweb

Appointed last-mile deliveries in France for retailers (furniture, appliances) in a booked
time slot. A shipment is a delivery with a slot and three milestones, not a parcel journey.
Tracked through the public recipient search.

## How it works

1. `direct`: one bounded `POST https://www.colisweb.com/api/search` with `{"value":"…"}` —
   the same request the tracking page makes, no session or token. `redirect: 'error'`.
   - 400, 404 or 422 is not-found.
   - An empty HTTP 500 is `IndeterminateError` (502), not not-found — see Notes.
   - Other non-2xx is not-found if the body says "not found", "introuvable" or "inconnu",
     otherwise `UpstreamHttpError`.
   - `parse()` requires `searchValue` to echo the requested number.

## Notes

- A validly shaped unknown number answers an empty HTTP 500. Colisweb's UI shows its
  "not found" card for it, but a broken backend returns the same bytes. Mapping it to 404
  would stop retries and tell the user something we don't know.
- Numbers are 8–32 digits. Detection suggests Colisweb for eight digits, a length two other
  carriers share. Longer numbers collide with too many carriers, so they are reached by
  pasting a `colisweb.com` link or picking the carrier.
- Events are the three milestone timestamps (`deliveryConfirmationDate`, `pickedUpDate`,
  `deliveredDate`), newest first. When no milestone carries the current step's stage, one
  time-less entry is prepended so the stage stays visible.
- Steps are compared with case and separators removed: the same step appears as `pickedUp`,
  `picked_up` and `PICKED_UP` across Colisweb's surfaces. The endpoint sends no wording; the
  French descriptions are ours.
- `package_return_failed` maps to `returned`, not `failed_attempt`: the failure is about the
  return leg.
- An unlisted step gives no `current_stage` and a stage-less event, so the sync classifies it.
- Milestone timestamps carry their own offset and are kept verbatim.
- The estimate is the booked slot the page shows, `startsAt` to `endsAt`, as
  `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm–HH:mm`. The endpoint sends UTC instants and the page prints them on
  French clocks, so the slot is restated on Paris time. A slot whose end is missing, not after
  its start or on another day keeps only the day it starts, and one without an offset the day
  it is written with. It is given only while the delivery is booked, picked up or out for
  delivery, and not while a reschedule is under way, when the page shows a message instead. A
  slot that ended before the newest milestone is dropped.
- The sender is the retailer (`clientName`), which the page names in its messages. The
  recipient block is never retained; a test asserts it.

## Limitations

- No scan locations, weight or dimensions.

## Testing

`npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/colisweb` (no env vars). It asserts
that an unknown number returns the indeterminate empty-500 result.
