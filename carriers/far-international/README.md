# FAR International

FAR International is 泛远国际, a Hangzhou cross-border forwarder whose site is far800.com, with
end-to-end lines to the Americas and Europe. Universal providers name it FAR International. The
adapter reads FAR's own results page for its waybills.

## How it works

1. `direct`: the tracker's results page is `GET https://www.far800.com/logistics/result?key=<number>`,
   server-rendered HTML without a cookie, key or CAPTCHA, and the adapter sends the same request.
2. `retry`: one more read when the first fails to connect or hangs. The first gets half of the
   budget.

## Notes

- Only the entry whose number is the whole number asked is read.
- A scan with an offset in its zone column gets an instant at that offset, and the scans are then
  ordered by instant. Older parcels have an empty zone column: those scans keep their wall clock
  and the page's order, and consumers can date them by place. ParcelsApp names the carrier "FAR"
  and drops the offsets, so its copies keep their wall clock too.
- Older scans pair Chinese wording with its English translation, of which the English is kept.
  Newer scans are English or Chinese, with the last-mile carrier's own wording near the end. They
  are staged by the wording recorded in [statuses.json](statuses.json), then the shared rules.
- The status above the scans is not read: it can still read 在途 (in transit) under a delivery.
  The delivery date beside it is not read either; `delivered_at` is the delivery scan's instant.
- The last-mile label is often listed after the parcel reached the departure hub, so it is no
  step back.
- The last-mile number becomes `delivery_tracking_number` when it is not FAR's own.
- A number the tracker has nothing for shows an empty list, which is no history rather than a
  missing parcel. Redirects, 404s and browser checks are never read as a missing parcel.

## Numbers

Its waybills are FAR, two letters, ten digits and YQ, the layout of forwarders on the Hualei
(华磊) platform, who open their waybills with their own code, as [GZYL](../gzyl/README.md) does.
FAR's own tracker answers such a number with its history, and
[Ship24's FAR International page](https://www.ship24.com/couriers/far-tracking) describes the same
layout with a placeholder example. No other carrier's rule takes the FAR code, so
`far-international-1` has high confidence.

## Links

`www.far800.com/logistics/result?key=` followed by the number opens a parcel, also under `/en/` in
English. The page takes any number, so the link names FAR only for one in its layout.

## Testing

Set `FAR_INTERNATIONAL_TRACKING_NUMBER` and optionally `FAR_INTERNATIONAL_UNKNOWN_NUMBER` outside
the repository, then run `npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/far-international`.
