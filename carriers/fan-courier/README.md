# FAN Courier

Romanian FAN Courier parcels, FANbox ones included, through the anonymous lookup of FAN
Courier's own AWB tracker.

## How it works

1. `direct`: a POST of the form the tracking page sends, `action=get_awb`, the AWB and
   `lang=en-US`, to `https://www.fancourier.ro/limit-tracking.php`. The JSON reply carries
   every event with its code, wording, town and wall clock. No cookie, nonce, account or
   CAPTCHA is needed: the page loads reCAPTCHA keys, but its tracking lookup sends no
   token.

## Numbers

Every AWB found has thirteen digits: in FAN Courier's API 2.0 documentation, in an
open-source client, in lookups archived from its tracker and in the tracker's own replies.
They start with `2`, `4` or `7000`, but FAN publishes no length, prefix or check-digit rule.
Thirteen digits are shared with several posts and couriers, so a low-confidence rule offers
FAN Courier for those starts alongside them, and recognition asks it first for a parcel from
Romania. No other carrier's sample starts with `70`, so `fan-courier-2` puts FAN Courier first
for the `7000` series wherever the parcel comes from. The adapter refuses any other shape
without a request.

## Notes

- The reply must name the requested AWB in `awbNumber`. An unknown AWB comes back without
  one, with the requested number in `content` and the tracker's "not found" message, in
  English or Romanian; only that reply is not found. Another message, an AWB without events,
  an empty reply, a rejected request or a missing page is inconclusive, and a Cloudflare page
  is a challenge.
- Events are mapped by code in [status.ts](status.ts). The codes and their names come from
  the event list in FAN Courier's API documentation; S56 (handed in at a FANbox or collect
  point) and S65 (held for the next transport abroad) are named only by the tracking page's
  own code. Codes whose meaning no source settles, such as S46, keep no stage.
- A refusal or a return is an exception, not a return to the sender: the return travels under
  an AWB of its own, which the page shows and the adapter does not follow.
- The page hides the events after the last delivery, and so does the adapter.
- Clocks carry no offset and stay local wall times, read in the catalog zone.
- The contents, weight, dimensions, payment date, related AWBs and the masked name of the
  person who signed are never read.
- Recognition asks the tracker and knows an AWB when it returns events.

## Links

FAN Courier's tracker writes the AWB into its address as `?tracking={number}` and renders
that number back when the page loads, on `/awb-tracking/` and on the English `/en/awb-track/`.
Older links put the AWB in `awb` or in the path.

## Limitations

Reference searches, which the page also accepts, are not supported. The reply has no
estimate, sender or pickup point.

## Testing
