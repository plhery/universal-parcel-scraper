# ZTO Express

Chinese domestic ZTO waybills use the [official tracker](https://www.zto.com/check).
Number shapes overlap other carriers; only a matching response confirms ownership.
ZTO International uses a separate network and tracker.
Its waybills, 771 and eleven digits, are tracked as [ZTO International](../zto-international/README.md).

The adapter first posts to `hdgateway.zto.com/batchGetTrace`. A verification response
can fall back to the bundled TRAWL image. The page obtains a Dingxiang challenge
from `mapi.zto.com/captcha/image2`, solves a slider and, when requested, clicks
Chinese characters in order using local OCR. It asks for another puzzle when it cannot
read one, at most twice. The page submits its own verification
token and repeats tracking in the same context. Tokens and recipient details stay
inside that context.

Verification can fail or exceed the lookup budget. The challenge reason says where it
stopped, from the [shared set](../../ARCHITECTURE.md), and the service's `zto.verification`
warning has each puzzle's detail. Enabled universal providers
remain available for those failures and for fuller history: the public PC tracker
suppresses earlier traces even after verification. The adapter marks its history
as incomplete and keeps the carrier's epoch scan clocks.

ZTO takes no part in recognition. Its gateway challenges a server's probes, the page's
verification is not solved within a probe's budget, and most twelve-digit numbers it would
be asked about belong to FedEx, which issues the same shape.

The legacy image endpoint does not supply the page's plain-code challenge. Mobile
H5 tracking requires a signed-in ZTO account, and the Android app
(`cn.beekee.zhongtong`) protects its request implementation. The unauthenticated
ZTO International route does not establish domestic shipment ownership.

## Testing

Set `ZTO_TRACKING_NUMBER` and `FLARESOLVERR_URL` privately, then run
`npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/zto`.
