/**
 * Packeta status vocabulary.
 *
 * Two independent maps, because Packeta reports status twice:
 * - `packetStatusId` on the parcel, a closed numeric vocabulary. An unmapped id
 *   is schema drift, so the result reports `unknown` rather than guessing.
 * - The event sentences in `trackingDetails[].text`. There is no per-event
 *   code; the request pins the locale to English and real parcels confirmed
 *   these sentences are canned templates, so fixed substring matching is safe.
 *   An unrecognized sentence keeps no stage: the sync classifies it and records
 *   where the final stage came from.
 *
 * Provenance: derived from the prior-art client
 * https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-packeta (MIT), and from the id
 * names the public tracking page's own script declares (read 2026-10-09).
 * `packetStatusId` "1" (waiting for the hand-over), "3" (delivered), "4" (cancelled),
 * "5" (returned to sender) and "21" are live-confirmed; the other ids are reconstructed. The script also
 * names SENT_BY_MAIL, TO_BE_SENT_BY_MAIL and PROBLEMATIC_CAPTURE, left unmapped
 * because their names do not say where the parcel is. The event sentences were
 * confirmed live on 2026-08-19 against real delivered parcels (values
 * fictionalized in that project's fixtures); the return's sentence on 2026-10-09.
