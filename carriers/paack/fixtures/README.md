# Paack fixtures

- `delivered-order.json`: `routes/tracking.order` loader payload for a delivered order with
  an earlier incorrect-address attempt and a delivery window. Built around the order number
  from Paack's public API examples; every retailer, recipient, contact, address and
  `variables` field is a `PRIVATE …` placeholder so the test can assert none leaks.
- `label-barcode-order.json`: the same loader for an order looked up by its label barcode,
  with the structure of a live reply. `external_id` is the retailer's own reference, not the
  barcode. The event headers show `expected_delivery_ts` as the delivery day and time slot,
  and the timeline lists the steps still to come without a timestamp. Times and the delivery
  postcode are synthetic; retailer and order references are `PRIVATE …` placeholders.
- `pudo-ready-order.json`: the same loader for an order waiting at a PaackGo Point
  (`droppedInPudo`), built from the tracking page's code and translations rather than a live
  reply: the step labels, `pudo_name`, the one-string `pudo_address` and the fields the page
  prints next to them. The PaackGo Point steps' ids (`PUDO1`…) and their `variables` are
  placeholders. The point's name and address are invented; the pickup code, QR link and every
  recipient field are `PRIVATE …` placeholders so the test can assert none leaks.
