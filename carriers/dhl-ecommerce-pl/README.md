# DHL eCommerce Poland

DHL's domestic parcel network in Poland, formerly DHL Parcel Polska. German
DHL Paket is [dhl](../dhl/README.md); the Benelux network is
[dhl-ecommerce-nl](../dhl-ecommerce-nl/README.md).

## Retrieval

The guest API at `mojdhl.pl/api/dhl/public` issues a request challenge, then
accepts the number and its proof at `shipment/status`. The response must name
the whole requested number and contain one shipment. An empty shipment list
without a number type confirms absence; several shipments are ambiguous.

With the optional TRAWL service, the adapter uses that shipment's confirmed
waybill to request scan history from `sprawdz.dhl.com.pl`. A fresh context
rejects optional cookies, completes the page's reCAPTCHA flow, and submits
its form. The captured POST and the returned history must both name the
waybill. Recipient acknowledgements, form tokens and self-service links are
excluded before the browser response leaves the service.

The history page words its scans in English or Polish, as the `lang` it is
opened with (`en-gb` or `pl-pl`) says, and keeps that language in a cookie for
the form. The helper opens it only with `lang=en-gb`, so every lookup reads
English history whatever its `language`.

The browser step includes the API confirmation. If history retrieval fails,
`direct` returns the confirmed summary with the browser failure recorded.
Without TRAWL, `direct` asks only the API. A connection failure can retry the
complete HTTP lookup with a fresh proof. HTTP recognition always uses this
HTTP-only path.

## Data and limitations

The API supplies the current status, sender and delivery estimate. Its receipt
time is an instant; posting dates are calendar days. History rows retain
facility-local clocks without an invented offset, including international
scans. Unknown history wording remains unclassified.

The DHL-specific helper uses TRAWL's native checkbox and audio solver.
A carrier-scoped copy retains the upstream algorithm and replaces its raw debug
output with fixed diagnostic events. Unsupported challenges and failed
verification retain the API summary. A solved checkbox alone is insufficient:
tracking requires a matching, nonempty history response. No recipient
postcode is needed for scan history.

Detection suggests eleven-digit waybills whose last digit is the check digit of
DHL Paket's Identcode: weights 4 and 9 alternate from the left over the first
ten digits. DHL does not document it for Poland, but every waybill archived
from its trackers passes it. Other accepted references, including
JJD licence plates, require the carrier to be named. Allegro Delivery numbers
are rejected because that service is tracked by Allegro.

## Testing

`npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/dhl-ecommerce-pl` checks a synthetic
missing number. Set `DHL_ECOMMERCE_PL_TRACKING_NUMBER` privately to test a real
shipment. Also set `FLARESOLVERR_URL` to test full history through TRAWL.
