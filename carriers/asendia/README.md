# Asendia

Cross-border mail and e-commerce carrier that hands parcels to a destination operator for the
last mile. It runs two public trackers:

- **A1** (Asendia USA), `a1.asendiausa.com/tracking/` (also `a1.asendia.com`). Its page reads a
  JSON API with no challenge. [adapter.ts](adapter.ts) asks it first.
- **Global portal** `track.asendia.com`, which serves the other subsidiaries, Asendia UK
  included. Every
  search needs a fresh Cloudflare Turnstile token. The optional `trawl` step submits its
  browser form after verification; [probe.ts](probe.ts) keeps the HTTP protocol canary.

Without a browser service, a number A1 does not know is not-found for this tracker only. With one configured, the adapter also asks the global portal. Peek can enrich
a summary through universal providers (see [routing](https://github.com/plhery/delivery-tracker/blob/main/docs/ROUTING.md)).

## How it works

1. `direct`:
   1. `GET a1.asendiausa.com/tracking/js/main.js`: the page's public client config (API base
      URL, a shared Basic authorization value, `X-AsendiaOne-ApiKey`, default branded tracking
      key). Same for every visitor, read at run time, cached six hours, never pinned. The API
      host must be an Asendia domain over HTTPS.
   2. `GET <api>/api/A1/TrackingBranded/Customer?trackingKey=`: the page's brand request, used
      to prove the key. A rejected key answers 204 "no customers configured": schema drift,
      not not-found.
   3. `GET <api>/api/A1/TrackingBranded/Tracking?trackingKey=&trackingNumber=`. A warm lookup
      is this single request.
   - The A1 outcome is `responseStatus.responseStatusCode` inside an HTTP 200: 200 with data,
     or 204 "no package data found".
   - A JSON 401/403 from a cached config re-reads the page once.
   - A plain browser-like `User-Agent` is required for A1; Cloudflare answers 403 "error code:
     1010" to library defaults.
   - 25-second budget per lookup, 10 seconds per request.

2. `trawl`, when A1 misses the number or retrieval fails:
   - Requires `FLARESOLVERR_URL` or the library's `trawlUrl`, running this repository's TRAWL image.
   - Uses a fresh browser context, waits for the portal's CAPTCHA configuration and its
     verified search button, then submits the whole number. The page owns its token; the
     hidden input and the generic solver's result do not establish verification.
   - Captures only a search request containing that one identifier and projects the response
     onto tracking fields. A refusal remains a challenge or rate limit, never not-found.
   - The portal shows the current status to anyone and the scans only against the recipient's
     name or delivery postcode. With the optional postcode, the helper opens the page's own
     dialog and submits it with a fresh token; the reply counts only when its request carried
     that postcode and the whole number. The name is never asked.
   - Without a postcode, or when the portal refuses it (`context_code` 1100 inside an HTTP
     200), the answer is `summary_only`, with no invented scan or update clock.
   - A successful A1 result stands. A global not-found cannot erase an A1 failure.
   - Default lookup budget with a browser service is 65 seconds; HTTP gets at most 25 seconds,
     and browser cleanup has reserved time.

## Notes

- A bad key also yields 204 "no package data", so a 204 is reported as not-found only if the
  key was proven in the last 15 minutes. Otherwise the key is checked first; if it moved, the
  page is re-read and the lookup repeated once. Without this, a rotated key would bench every
  Asendia parcel as not-found.
- The A1 reply echoes nothing about the query. It is bound to the request through the three
  references its summary reports (carrier original, customer, vendor).
- A1 scan codes mean different things per `eventSource` (USPS reuses `10` and `B1`, Broadreach
  uses `B8`), so codes are read only for Asendia's own sources:
  - `A1 … Data` sources: A1 codes (`1` to `1.2` registered, `2` accepted, `2.1` to `2.3` in
    transit).
  - `A1 Manual Entry`: Asendia's hand-keyed linehaul scans (`ME3` flight departed, `ME4` flight
    arrived, in transit).
  - `FullTrack API`: Asendia's harmonized codes from a published list (linked in
    [status.ts](status.ts)). Consumer-return `RET*` and inquiry `CLAIM*` codes are unmapped.
  - Partners (`USPS TrackV2 API`, `BROADREACH API`, `DAI API`, …): exact wording, else the
    shared rules.
- The parcel app's review (`statusMap`) has the code and wording but not the source: a code
  Asendia lists is Asendia's, another is read by the partner's wording, and a scan without a
  code by a partner's wording or the global portal's phrases. DAI Post's round, which the
  portal's phrases read as a delivery, stays open there without its code, since the stored scan
  does not keep its source.
- DAI Post's relayed scans (`DAI API`) carry the wall clock DAI Post's own tracker shows, the
  scan's local time, labelled UTC. They are read as DAI Post's adapter reads them: in the
  country's zone when it keeps one clock, such as New Zealand or the United Kingdom.
  Australian scans, scans without a country and the label-data scan (`CI02`) keep a
  `local_time`. They keep A1's order.
- A1's declared final-mile link becomes `delivery_carrier` only through catalog link rules; the
  vendor reference becomes `delivery_tracking_number`, so the host can propose one
  confirmation lookup with that operator.
- A1 weight is converted from pounds; `destination_country` comes from the summary.
- An A1 scan without an explicit offset is dropped.
- `AS` + 9 digits + `US` needs no S10 checksum: a real A1 number fails it. The generic postal
  rule excludes this shape.
- A1 also accepts customer references, merchant references and last-mile numbers. They are
  not specific to Asendia, so there is no detection rule for them. S10 numbers issued by a
  partner post stay with that post.
- eBay International Standard Delivery's `ESUS` + 9 digits are a low suggestion with DHL
  eCommerce: eBay names DHL Global Mail's tracker for them, and A1 answers some. eBay
  International Shipping's `EEUS`, nine digits, the destination's country code and a digit are
  the same suggestion: A1 answers some and DHL eCommerce's tracker others. Recognition
  asks Asendia first: A1, as the lookup does, but never the global portal's browser. Asendia's other layouts are selected outright and need no recognition.
- Events keep time, wording, code and city/province/country only. Address lines, postal codes,
  service name and order reference are never read.

## Rejected approaches

- Calling the global search without browser verification: it requires a fresh Turnstile token.
- [SendNow](https://send.asendia.com/es-en/tracking/) has a separate public tracking API at
  `/.api/tracking/ASENDIA.ES.LIVE/tracking/<number>`. It searches SendNow bookings, not the
  global portal's parcel corpus, so it is not used as a replacement for European tracking.
- Older group trackers: `tracking.asendia.com`, with its `alliot` API, and Asendia UK's
  `uktracking.asendia.com` (formerly wnDirect) redirect to the portal; `m-tracking`,
  `trackandtrace` and `etracking` no longer resolve.
- Asendia Sync and MyAsendia need an account. Asendia has no consumer tracking app.
- The documented A1 Tracking v2.0 API (`a1api.asendiausa.com`): 401 without account
  credentials. The branded endpoint is what the public page uses.

## Limitations

- Parcels outside A1 need the optional browser service. Turnstile can still
  refuse a browser; that failure remains a challenge.
- Global scans need the delivery postcode as Asendia recorded it. Some parcels a partner
  delivers carry no recipient record there, and no postcode opens them.
- No delivery estimate.
- A1 dates other partners' scans in true UTC: a Swiss Post scan at 18:20 `+02:00` is A1's 16:20
  `+00:00`, and a German delivery round UPU shows at 09:07 local is A1's 07:07. USPS scans were
  not checked against USPS, and one `A1 Processed Data` scan looked like a California wall
  clock labelled UTC: 22:04 `+00:00`, seven hours before its 05:04 check-in, at the minute UPU
  dates the posting at a California office. Offsets are kept as sent. USPS pre-shipment scans
  are date-only and arrive as midnight UTC.
- A structural change to `main.js` fails as schema drift.

## Testing

`npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/asendia`. `adapter.live.test.ts` checks a synthetic
unknown number on A1, after validating the page's public key. Set `ASENDIA_LIVE_NUMBER` to an
authorized current shipment to also check matching history; that test is skipped without it
because A1 drops old public examples. Offline fixtures cover history parsing. `probe.live.test.ts` checks that the
portal still rejects an invalid Turnstile token. The probe reads a real token from
`ASENDIA_TURNSTILE_TOKEN` for manual runs. Set `FLARESOLVERR_URL` and
`ASENDIA_GLOBAL_LIVE_NUMBER` to check the global browser response against an authorized parcel;
add `ASENDIA_GLOBAL_LIVE_POSTCODE` to open its scans. Without a matching postcode the history
stays locked while the current status is returned.
