# JD Logistics

Tracks international waybills through the international website's anonymous feed. When that
feed holds no history, the JDAZ and JDJ domestic series can use the public domestic tracker
through TRAWL. A series is a route suggestion; the response must confirm the whole identifier.

## How it works

One JSON POST queries the website's international tracking proxy. The parent reference must
match the requested number and contain one waybill with dated scans. Multiple pieces are
rejected because selecting one could return another parcel's progress.

For the domestic series, an inconclusive international answer can continue through `trawl`.
The helper opens the official order-search page in a fresh context and uses its own search,
guest session and service-selected verification branch. Its single-icon worker makes one
bounded attempt. An uncertain match stops without clicking, refreshing the puzzle or sending
a history request. Accepted verification must still belong to the original guest session;
only then may the page query `trackNoPin`. The helper also permits the normal proxy request
when the service itself selects the branch without verification.

Domestic replies require exactly one matching `rawWaybillCode` and an explicit `exists`.
Only a bound `exists:false` is not found. Empty or refused replies stay inconclusive, and
browser failure or abstention leaves enabled providers available. No phone, login, map,
attachment or proof-of-delivery route is entered. HTTP recognition never starts this browser
step; browser recognition is a separate opt-in.

The domestic page displays `createTime`, otherwise `trackDay` with `trackTime`. An epoch or
explicit offset keeps its instant. A clock without an offset stays local, in the carrier's
order; the page's language does not establish its zone. Contact and recipient clauses are
removed from scan wording. Wordless or contact-only rows with valid clocks are omitted;
the remaining history is marked incomplete so enabled providers can fill it. A reply with
no readable scans stays inconclusive. Invalid clocks and malformed rows still fail, and a
capped history is also marked incomplete.

For international history, each scan keeps its operation code as its provider code and takes its stage from it
(`status.ts`); a scan with an unknown code is classified by its wording. An order shipped from
JD's own warehouse abroad is accepted there while it is picked and weighed, then handed to a
last-mile partner such as GOFO, whose steps JD relays. GOFO's label comes under a code JD has
shown with that step alone, and GOFO's loading at a hub, before its delivery station, under the
code of JD's courier out with the parcel, so their wording decides them rather than the code.
The newest scan decides the status. The courier's name and phone are dropped from the out-for-delivery wording
(`wording.ts`).

A scan's location is its city and its country in English. JD names the country in Chinese in
`routeCountry` on some scans, by its full name or a usual short form, and in English in
`routeProvinceName` on its international lanes, so either gives the same name. A country read
neither way stays as written; a province adds nothing. A city that is the country itself, such
as Hong Kong, Macau or Singapore, stands alone.

Each scan's wall clock is local to the scan, whatever zone the request names. A scan also
carries epoch milliseconds and a declared fixed offset (`UTC+3`). It is dated, in that offset,
only when the epoch reads as its wall clock there. Every country its place fields name must
also have a single zone known here, and that zone must keep that offset at that wall clock,
neither skipping nor repeating it. Beside the shared single-zone table, the parser knows Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Macau, so a Saudi scan is dated at +3 and
stays local at +8. A country spanning several zones (United States, Australia, Indonesia,
Brazil), one not known here, or a country field read neither way keeps the clock local. So does
a place naming no country read here, such as a Chinese province and city without a country or
an abbreviation like `KSA`. Only a scan with no place at all, such as the order's creation, is
dated on its epoch and declared offset alone. A fully dated history is ordered by instant, ties
in JD's order; any local clock keeps JD's order, newest first.

## Limitations

Domestic recovery needs the TRAWL image with the JD helper. Its conservative matcher supports
one observed image geometry and declines other puzzles; it does not promise verification on
every lookup. Public unattended history has been observed for JDJ, while JDAZ coverage remains
unproved. Domestic clocks without a stated offset remain unresolved. Other domestic service
variants can require recipient inputs and are not followed. The international feed's empty
answer remains inconclusive with `portal_not_found`, never proof that a parcel does not exist.
A scan without an epoch is not dated from its declared zone alone.

## Testing

Set `JD_LOGISTICS_TRACKING_NUMBER` outside the repository and run
`npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/jd-logistics/adapter.live.test.ts`.
