# Blue Dart

Tracks domestic waybills through the official server-rendered third-party tracking page.
Detection offers an 11-digit waybill only when the first ten digits, divided by seven,
leave the last digit. Aramex numbers pass the same check, so the shape stays shared.

## How it works

One anonymous GET returns the shipment summary and scan table. The returned waybill must
match the requested number. The main tracking form uses a CAPTCHA; this read-only result
page needs no session or challenge token.

## Notes

Only scan-table rows become events, in the portal's newest-first order. Domestic scans use
India time; unresolved date labels stay separate from timestamps. Unknown wording keeps
its text without inheriting the shipment's current status. An unresolved date retains
its valid clock without creating an instant. Recipient and reference-number
rows, feedback forms and page scripts are excluded.

The no-information panel exists hidden in successful pages too. Only its server-provided
activation marker makes a missing summary a confirmed negative.

## Limitations

Reference-number searches and international partner histories are outside this adapter's scope.

## Testing

`npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/blue-dart`. Set
`BLUE_DART_TRACKING_NUMBER` to check an authorized real shipment.
