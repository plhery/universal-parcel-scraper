# Delhivery

Reads domestic parcel status and scans from the public consumer tracking feed.

## How it works

One GET with the website's Origin and Referer headers returns an identity-bound shipment.
It needs no merchant API token or account. An explicit invalid-or-old waybill response is
not-found; other empty replies remain schema failures.

## Notes

Future progress labels are excluded. Current status becomes a snapshot when no scan
reports it at the same instant; its timestamp is never assigned to an undated scan.
Calendar days and invalid date labels remain unresolved instead of becoming midnight scans.
Scan remarks, recipient information, coordinates, references and phone fields are excluded.

## Limitations

The public feed often omits historical scan dates. Displayed delivery periods are prose,
so the adapter does not convert them into an exact delivery estimate. Freight LR numbers
use a separate service and are outside this adapter's scope.

## Testing

`npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/delhivery`. Set
`DELHIVERY_TRACKING_NUMBER` to check an authorized real parcel.
