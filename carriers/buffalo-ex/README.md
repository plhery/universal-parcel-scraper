# BUFFALO

BUFFALO parcels use enabled universal providers. There is no dedicated adapter.

BUFFALO International Logistics ships parcels from China to South Africa, clears them through
South African customs and delivers them from its own depots or hands them to a local courier.

## Numbers

BUFFALO's tracker calls its number the order number. Archived lookups on its tracker show
BUFZA, ten digits and YQ; ParcelsApp names BUFFALO for BUFZA, a digit, SK, five digits and BUYQ.
The high-confidence rule claims both layouts: the BUFZA prefix and YQ suffix are BUFFALO's own. The former tracker used fifteen-digit order numbers; no rule claims
them, since many carriers print bare digit runs of that length. The customs reference the
tracker shows next to the number is not a tracking number.

## Statuses

ParcelsApp relays the scan of a parcel back at a BUFFALO depot after a round as a bare
"RETURNS", and the parcel leaves again the next morning. A rule scoped to BUFFALO and ParcelsApp
reads it as in transit; elsewhere the word can name a return to the sender.

## Links

`buffaloex.com/tracks.html?order={number}` is the address the site's home page form submits to;
the tracker opens with an empty form. Archived lookups used the former `track.html` page and the
`express/record` page with the same `order` parameter.

## Limitations

BUFFALO's tracker asks for the last four digits of the parcel's phone number, an image code and a
Cloudflare Turnstile check before it shows a history, and its app tracks only a signed-in
customer's orders, so BUFFALO stays on universal providers. Domestic South African orders start
`BUFEX-` and belong to BUFFALO's South African site, which answers requests from Europe, the
Americas and Asia with its firewall's block page.

## Testing

Provider live-test inputs and commands are in the
[provider READMEs](../../providers/README.md).
