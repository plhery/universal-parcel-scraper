/**
 * UPS status vocabulary.
 *
 * Nearly every scan in UPS's `GetStatus` reply carries a two-character
 * `actCode`, the official Track API's `status.code`. The code is the stable key: one wording can stand for two codes
 * ("Arrived at Facility" is both the origin scan `OR` and an arrival `AR`), and
 * the wording arrives HTML-escaped and reworded. The adapter maps the code to a
 * stage and leaves a scan with an unmapped code to the shared wording
 * classifier. A scan sent without a code is read by its exact wording only.
 *
 * The shipment detail also carries `progressBarType`, a coarse token, and
 * English prose. They decide the status only when the newest scan's code is
 * unmapped, and for the rendered page, which has no scans.
